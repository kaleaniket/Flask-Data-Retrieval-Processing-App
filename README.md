# Flask-Data-Retrieval-Processing-App

# Flask Data Retrieval and Processing System

This Flask application simulates a simplified version of a data retrieval and processing system. It includes API endpoints to fetch and process data, and to retrieve the processed data.

## Features

1. API Endpoint for Data Retrieval: Fetches data from an external service (simulated with mock data) and processes it.
2. Data Processing: Converts all text to uppercase.
3. Data Storage: Stores processed data in temporary in-memory storage (Python dictionary).
4. API Endpoint for Processed Data Retrieval: Retrieves and returns the processed data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
